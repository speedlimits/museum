 * This is the stream interface by which applications will send packets to the world
 * Each protocol will provide a specific function similar to the connect and bind functions 
 * but with protocol-specific arguments (such as host, port)
 * As soon as connect is called, streams may be cloned or data may be sent across them
 * When the stream finds out whether a connection attempt failed or succeeded, 
 * it will call the connectionCallback
 * When the other side calls clone() the first side will receive a substreamCallback with the callback it provided on connect() or listen()
 * Once a stream is clone()d, it may outlast the parent stream and may receive further substream callbacks on the original substreamCallback provided
